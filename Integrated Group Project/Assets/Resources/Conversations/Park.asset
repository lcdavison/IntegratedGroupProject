  - Welcome to the Park, my name is Jasper.
  - I would like to show you how to round a number to the nearest ten.
  - 'To do this you need to check the unit value of the number.

    For example, the unit value of 45 is 5.'
  - 'You must then check whether the value is less than 5, if it is then you will
    need to round the ten value down.

    Otherwise, you will need to round it up.'
  - 'For example, round the value 35 to the nearest ten.

    The second value is 5, therefore the number must be rounded up to 40.'
