  help_information: "Addition\r\nYou can use a number line to add two numbers! For
    example, 5 + 4 = 9, as 9 is 4 numbers away to the right from 5. \r\nIf you need
    to add bigger numbers, you can use column addition. Start adding numbers from
    the right. For example:\r\n    23\r\n + 32\r\n_____\r\n    55 \r\n\r\nSubtraction
    \r\nYou can use a number line to subtract! Unlike with addition, you will have
    to go to the left on the number line. For example, 10 - 5 = 5, as 5 is 5 numbers
    away from 10 on the number line. \r\nAgain, if the numbers are too big, you can
    use column subtraction! Make sure you always write WHAT you subtract below the
    number you subtract FROM. For example, if you\x19re subtracting 15 from 41:\r\n
    \  41\r\n- 15\r\n_____\r\n  26\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiplication\r\nIf you multiply a
    number by 0, the answer will be 0.\r\n2 x 0 = 0\r\nIf you multiply a number by
    1, the answer will be the same number.\r\n12 x 1 = 12\r\nIf you multiply a number
    by 10, put 0 at the end.\r\n34 x 10 = 340 \r\nIf you multiply a number by 100,
    put two 0 at the end.\r\n34 x 100 = 3400\r\nThe number on the left shows how many
    times the number on the right was added to itself.\r\nFor example, 2 x 6 = 12,
    as 6 + 6 = 12. \r\nSometimes, if you\x19re doing a harder problem, it is a good
    idea to break it down. For example, 5 x 60 = 5 x 6 x 10. 5 x 6 = 30, and 30 x
    10 = 300. \r\n\r\nDivision\r\nIf you divide a number by 1, the answer will be
    the same number. \r\n51 / 1 = 51\r\nIf you divide a number by 10, move everything
    one place to the right.\r\n650 / 10 = 65\r\nIf you divide a number by 100, move
    everything two places to the right.\r\n6500 / 100 = 65\r\nUsing Number Line \r\nIn
    some cases, you can use a number line to work out how to do division. For example,
    what is 40 / 8? You can look at the number line to see how many intervals of 8
    there are from 0 to 40. There are 8 intervals, therefore 40 / 8 = 5. \r\nShort
    division:\r\nHow to divide 459 by 9?\r\nFirst, see if 4 can be divided by 9. 4
    cannot be divided by 9, so see if 45 is divisible by 9. 45 / 9 = 5, so write down
    5. Then, see if 9 can be divided by 9. 9 / 9 = 1, write down 1 after 5. The answer
    is 51.\r\nSometimes, there will be a remainder. For example, let\x19s divide 469
    by 9. We cannot divide 4 by 9, so let\x19s add 6. 46 / 9 = 5 (remainder 1), so
    write down 5 and keep 1. Add 9, and see if 19 can be divided by 9. 19 / 9 = 2
    (remainder 1). Therefore, the answer is 52 (1 remainder). \r\n"
