  - Welcome to the church of BIDMAS
  - We would like to show you how to solve equations using, Addition, Subtraction,
    Multiplication, and Division
  - To add two numbers together you must start at the value to the left of the '+'
    sign, the right side is the distance from the start to the answer
  - For example, 1 + 3 = 4. Since 4 is 3 numbers after 1 on a number line
  - Subtracting two numbers is similar, except you count backwards instead of forwards
  - For example, 4 - 3 = 1
  - To multiply two numbers together take the number to the left of the 'X' sign,
    this is how many times to add the number on the right to itself
  - For example, 2 x 4 = 8. Since 4 + 4 = 8
  - Another example is 3 x 6 = 18. Since 6 + 6 + 6 = 18
  - Division can be tricky, but I'm sure your're up to the challenge
