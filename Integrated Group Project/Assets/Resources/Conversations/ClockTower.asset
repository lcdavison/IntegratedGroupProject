  - Welcome to the Big Ben Time!
  - People use different clocks to tell the time, but I am sure you will not get confused!
  - There are 24 hours in a day, starting from midnight. So if the time is 1 in the
    afternoon, some clocks will be at 13 hours
  - 'People can also use AM and PM to say what time it is. AM is the first 12 hours
    of the day, PM is the last 12 hours of the day.

    This means that 1 in the afternoon is 1 PM.'
  - There are some clocks that use Roman Numbers, so it is important to understand
    them.
  - For example, I = 1, V = 5, X = 10
  - If you want to know what are the other numbers, click on the help button
