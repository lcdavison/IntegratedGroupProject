  help_information: "Currency \u2013 money that a country uses.\r\n\nThere are many
    different currencies in the world. In the UK, we use pounds. Many European countries
    use Euros. In the United States, people use Dollars, in China \u2013 Chinese Yuan.
    To convert between different currencies, you need to know the exchange rate. \r\nIf
    one Chinese Yuan is equal to 0.11 Pound, to find out how much 5 Pounds is in Chinese
    Yuan, you need to divide 5 by 0.11. If you need to convert the other way around,
    for example 5 Chinese Yuan into Pounds, you need to multiply 5 by 0.11.\r\n"
